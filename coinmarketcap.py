"""
Pulls the latest prices for NEO-USD from Coinmarketcap's ticker API
Keeps a buffer of X price snapshots (CMC updates every c. 5 minutes)

The Oracle Judge will create a new game which is based on a timestamp
The goal is to submit the price corresponding to the snapshot that is closest to that timestamp (<= TS)

To avoid the possibility of CMC updating in less than 5 minutes with a closer time,
Oracle Judge waits 10 minutes after this timestamp before creating a game
So everyone will have seen a TS from CMC after the goal timestamp and therefore can figure out what their Closest Timestamp should be
